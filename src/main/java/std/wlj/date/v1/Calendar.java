 * Calendar: a system for fixing the beginning, length, and divisions of the year and arranging the days and longer divisions of time (weeks, months) in a
 * definite order. (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary). Calendars usually have some relation to, and try to model, the natural order of the earth, moon
 * and sun. Often, a religion and a calendar are closely tied. Many cultures use multiple calendars simultaneously: civil, religious, historical.

 * n.b. The YEAR value is always relative to the Christian Era, and zero is not a valid value. In the Christian Era, BC years are negative: -1 == 1BC, -2 ==
 * 2BC, etc. and AD years are positive: 1, 2, 3.
